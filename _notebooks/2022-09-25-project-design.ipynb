    "- We also had an idea to make a data collector for AP Stats where we are starting our first data collecting project\n",
    "- We also considered a website modeled after Goodreads but specifically for DNHS students to find and rate books\n",
    "- One of the final ideas we considered was a market place also soley for DNHS students for secondhand books and clothing. \n",

    "- We decided on the marketplace as we had more ideas as to how to impliment the design properly "
