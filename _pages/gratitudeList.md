# Gratitude List
- I think this page is going to be great to look back on whenever I'm feeling stressed, overwhelmed, or overall quite down. This part of my blog is designed to make me think more positively and look forward to things in my life :) 

## Notes from Psychology and the Good Life
- Psychology and the good life is a class that Laurie Santos created at Yale when she realized how unhappy students were
- She wanted to teach both the science and practical application of being happy 
- Specifically, how to change behavior and habits 
- It takes practice to actually become a happy person and change your behaviors to fit what you are trying to make your new habits
